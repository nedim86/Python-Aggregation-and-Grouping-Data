# Aggregation and Grouping Python Data

In these exercises we will show the most important functions for data aggregation in the Pandas library:
- groupby()
- crosstab()
- pivot_table()

We will work on each of these techniques through interesting demo examples. After each demo example you will have the opportunity to do additional lab exercises. 

In the demo and lab examples we use 3 different data sets (big_mart_sales.csv, nba.csv, orders.xls). The listed files are an integral part of this repository.
